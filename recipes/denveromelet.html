        <p><img src="./img/denveromelet.jpg"></p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A change of pace from a French omelet, the Denver omelet is known for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. It's one of the first foods I've ever learned to cook professionally, as a line cook in high school. Make it a complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced smoked ham</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <p>*Recipe yields 1 servings</p>


        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat eggs until just combined; do not over-beat.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper. Sprinkle in a nice pinch of salt and a touch of pepper. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until onions start to soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in the eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed. Quickly run the spatula along the edges of the omelet.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over the omelet. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Fold omelet in half with your spatula and transfer to a plate.</li>
        </ol>
